# UnSaid – Anonymous Letter Sharing Website

**UnSaid** is a minimalist and emotionally-driven web app where users can write and share anonymous letters — thoughts they’ve never said out loud.  
It’s designed with calm colors, large typography, and generous white space to make reading and writing feel intimate and safe.

## 💡 Inspiration

The project was inspired by the idea that everyone has something they wish they had said — a thank you, an apology, a confession.
**UnSaid** gives those words a place to live.

If you want, I can also create a **Figma-style project preview image** and embed it into this README so it looks professional on GitHub. That would make your repository stand out a lot.  

Do you want me to make that preview image?

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
